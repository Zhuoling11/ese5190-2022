# Lab Feedback Questions #
Q- Which parts of the lab specification have you found most confusing or difficult to understand? Be specific, and quote any parts of the lab description relevant to your answer (e.g., "modify the PIO/DMA logic analyzer example to record a timestamped trace of an RP2040-ADPS9960 exchange while the BOOT button is pressed.") I will make particular notice of anything that seems underspecified (e.g., words whose meaning is not clear from context, or conflicting interpretations of a deliverable).
At first, I couldn't understand the addresses and values of the registers, because we didn't know the physical address of each register, and the chip also stored the values randomly. However, I asked other people for help and found that they used their defined addresses. They use important pointer type variables.
However, the pio in parts 6 and 7 is also difficult to understand. We need to use analyzer to record and pio to do transactions. Many of the functions in analyzer.c are difficult for me to understand because I don't know what they do and where they come from. I can only modify them,

Which lab topics have you found most confusing or difficult to understand?
Par6-Part8. it is too brief for me to understand.

Which parts of the lab have you found most difficult to implement?
Part7, because it needs us to use pio to operate the whole system.

What steps have you taken to resolve these difficulties?
I think the discreption of part1-part10 is too brief so that I may not understand the first step in every part. It makes me confused again and again.
* Referred to other examples online as well as fellow classmates' work. Especially the work of Sahil-M-M
* Asked the professor for an explanation.
* Discussed with classmates.
